# Update
This app has not been actively maintained for years now due to many reasons (I switched job, company was sold etc). Unfortunately, I don’t have time nor interest to continue with the development, but some cool and smart people are still working on Open Refine: https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine
 

Please note that all the extensions are available as separate repositories, but they are outdated, too due to similar reasons as stated above.

Please visit OpenRefine project to check on the latest development of this amazing tool and the extensions they already integrated into it.




# LODRefine

LODRefine is LOD-enabled version of OpenRefine. 


OpenRefine is a power tool that allows you to load data, understand it,
clean it up, reconcile it to master database, and augment it with data coming from
Freebase or other web sources. All with the comfort and privacy of 
your own computer.

### What's the difference between OpenRefine and LODRefine?
LODRefine is actually OpenRefine with integrated extensions that make transition from tabular data to Linked Data a bit easier.

Integrated extensions are:
- RDF extension
- DBpedia extension
- Crowdsourcing extension
- Stats extension
